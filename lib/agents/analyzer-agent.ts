The vulnerability exists in the LendingPool contract where the _withdraw function
calls an external contract before updating the user's balance:

\`\`\`solidity
function _withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    // Send tokens to user
    IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    
    // Update user balance - TOO LATE!
    userBalances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;
}
\`\`\`

This allows an attacker to recursively call back into the _withdraw function
before the balance is updated, draining the contract.
